As a transcriber working mostly in English, I’ve found Imla to be a game-changer. While I haven’t yet worked with other African dialects, my experience with Swahili transcription has been promising. I haven’t needed to use the translation feature much, but when I tried it, I got around 60% accuracy translating Swahili to English, which I’m sure will improve over time.

What really stands out to me is the transcription accuracy. If I’m being honest, I’d rate Imla at 100%, but to be fair, I’ll say 95% just to leave room for improvement. It has made my work so much easier, cutting down on time spent fixing errors. Not only is it incredibly accurate, but it's also cost-effective, which is important for me as a freelancer. Imla has truly enhanced my workflow, and I’m excited to keep using it as it evolves.
